QUESTIONS:
1. Pid namespaces are used to give a container the permission to create a process hierarchy.
2. This will allow the process to have its own private view of the filesystem,
    which can help to prevent it from accessing files that it should not have access to.
3. Linux cgroups are used to limit, isolate and monitor process resources.
4. The clone command is used to create a copy of an existing operating system.
    The fork command is used to create a new process from an existing one.
5. The chroot command changes the root directory for the current process and its children.
6. Procfs is a virtual file system that provides an interface to kernel data structures.
    It is used for debugging and performance monitoring.
